# Angular project boilerplate

This project was made for my personal use on projects which need basic Angular setup including material, flex layout
and firebase ready to use.

## Setup

1. Just add your Firebase credentials to environment.prod.ts and environment.ts.
You can find them in the "General" tab of app settings. They should look something like this:

<pre><code>
{
apiKey: "AIzaSyBsHfOW12312312312wbWfFDqML-Z9k",
     authDomain: "app.firebaseapp.com",
     databaseURL: "https://app.firebaseio.com",
     projectId: "app-id",
     storageBucket: "app-3bcdd.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "345155003213"
}
</pre>

2. Install packages
<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>
